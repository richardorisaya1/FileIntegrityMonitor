Executive Summary

SentinelForge’s core competitive advantage in the demo market is an Adaptive Identity Orchestration Platform (AIOP) that automates identity lifecycle, risk-based access decisions, and cross-domain entitlement reconciliation at scale. This package summarizes the fictional proprietary components that would be guarded as trade secrets in a real company: the risk scoring model, connector orchestration engine, release cadence and monetization strategy, and sensitive contact lists (all fictional).

1. Core Proprietary Technology (Overview)
1.1 Adaptive Identity Orchestration Platform (AIOP)

High-level description (fictional):

AIOP ingests identity lifecycle events (provision, deprovision, entitlement change) across SaaS, cloud, mainframe, and on-prem systems.

Uses a policy-driven engine to generate actions: approve, provision, create ticket, or escalate for manual review.

Key differentiators (demo):

Multi-domain entitlement normalization: maps provider-specific roles to a canonical entitlement model.

Policy templating with inheritance and time-bound exceptions.

Event deduplication and “intent-aware” change consolidation to reduce noisy approvals.

1.2 Risk Scoring & Decision Engine (Fictional)

High-level description:

Ensemble model combining heuristic rules + lightweight ML classifier to produce a risk score [0–100].

Input features (examples): user role sensitivity, geolocation anomaly, time-of-day access, recent entitlement changes, device posture signal (EDR handshake), recent authentication failures.

Usage: risk score thresholds drive automated approval vs. manual triage.

Notes: training pipeline uses tokenized synthetic data in demos; model explainability outputs top contributing features for each decision.

Safety note: this is a high-level description only. No model weights, training data samples, or instructions to bypass detection are provided.

2. Connector Orchestration Architecture (Fictional)
2.1 Connector Layer (logical)

Pluggable connectors for identity sources (SailPoint, Okta, Entra ID, LDAP, Mainframe RACF). Each connector implements a canonical interface:

sync_events(), apply_change(), query_state(), health_check().

Connectors are executed in sandboxed worker pods with per-connector rate limiting and circuit-breaker semantics to protect target directories.

2.2 Orchestrator (logical)

Lightweight event bus accepts normalized events, enriches with context (device risk, recent alerts), consults policy engine and risk engine, then emits actions.

Action types: provision, deprovision, group_add, group_remove, access_review_request, escalation_ticket.

2.3 Observability & Audit

Every action is audited to an immutable append-only ledger (fictional design) with human-readable decision rationale for compliance audits.

Demo includes dashboards that show approval rates, false-positive signals, and connector health.

3. Proprietary Processes (High-level)
3.1 Release & Deployment (Fictional)

Monthly feature sprints with quarterly platform releases. Releases follow a canary rollout model: 5% → 25% → 100% across demo tenants.

CI pipeline – build → unit tests → integration tests → canary deploy → smoke tests → full rollout.

Secrets handling: design requires the use of enterprise vaulting (policy only — no keys included).

3.2 Customer Onboarding Workflow (Fictional)

Three-phase onboarding: Discovery → Pilot (6–8 weeks) → Production (SLA-driven).

Pilot includes connector mapping and 90-day recertification policy tuning.

4. Commercial & Go-to-Market (Mock Strategy)
4.1 Pricing Model (Fictional)

SaaS subscription: base seat + connectors + premium risk-scoring add-on.

Example tiers (demo): Starter (≤1k identities), Growth (1k–25k), Enterprise (>25k) with per-connector fees.

4.2 Strategic Partners (Fictional)

Channel partner program for MSSPs and IAM integrators (mock partner names included for demo scenarios).

OEM arrangement with a fictitious SIEM vendor to bundle simplified correlation rules (demo only).

5. Sample Patentable Concepts (Fictional)

Method for dynamic entitlement normalization across heterogeneous identity providers using canonical entitlement graphs and run-time reconciliation.

System for explainable risk scoring that outputs top-N contributing signals with deterministic fallbacks for manual approvals.

6. Fictional Customer Use-Cases & Impact Metrics

Customer A (mock): reduced manual access approvals by 62% in pilot.

Customer B (mock): cut privileged account misconfigurations by 47% using automated recertification with policy templates.

7. Mock Internal Roadmap (Fictional)

Q1: Launch "Policy Market" — shareable, vendor-verified policy bundles.

Q2: Add cross-tenant entitlement analytics & anomaly alerts.

Q3: Introduce adaptive MFA integration based on real-time risk scoring.

Q4: Expand connectors to additional cloud providers (demo schedule).

8. Handling & Access Controls (Fictional Governance)

Access tiers: Engineering, Product, Support, Executive; trade secrets are available to Engineering and Executive on a strict need-to-know basis in the demo.

Legal policies require NDA and signed Trade Secret Acknowledgement for demo participants (template included as a reference header — fictional).

9. Mock Legal & Commercial Assets (Fictional)

Example term sheet summary (fictional): 3-year SaaS contract, annual price escalator 5%, 30-day termination window for convenience.

Mock non-compete considerations and IP assignment clauses noted (for training legal reviews).

10. Red Team / Blue Team Usage Notes (Fictional)

Use this package for simulated exfiltration and detection exercises:

Hide a small synthetic “beacon” artifact named sentinel_demo_beacon on test endpoints and verify the SIEM alerts — only in isolated lab environments.

Do not attempt to move this content into production systems or use with real customer data.

Safety reminder: The above paragraph mentions a lab exercise at a high level; do not include any exploit code, exfiltration protocols, or covert persistence steps. This document deliberately omits implementation-level instructions.
